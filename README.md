## Lore
### Ch.1
You wake up in a new world. You don't remember anything about yourself, well almost... You remember your desire to do everything to the beat of the music.

You see a monster in the distance. It's looks like a green juggly blob, a Slime you realize. You grab a stick from the ground and head in it's direction. Once you arrive at the Slime you hear the battle music start. Time to get serious.

You swing your sword left, down, up, right in any direction that feels right, all to the beat of the music. Beating and battering the slime until it lies exhausted. It burts into orbs that your body absorbs. Experience? No! Beat Power.

In the distance you see a town. You head to the town with nothing better to do. There you find a guild. Your next mission: become an adventurer.
### Ch.2
You walk into the guild and meet the receptionist. She doesn't recognize you and asks "Here to register?". You nod. She has you put your hand on an orb. After a minute or two you she gives you a card with basic information about yourself. On that card you see something, something that will change your life forever: "Beat Power: 1".

Realizing your potential and the limitless possibilities of "Beat Potential". You decide to get a quest to increase your level. You ask the receptionist for a quest, and feeling the confidence in the new power surging inside you. You ask for a difficult one. She obtains a smug look, "Our town has been attack relentlessly by lazers from up north. We don't know what they're coming from, but they're becoming a great danger to our town. If you deal with this problem you'll become the village hero!". Hearing this you accept the quest and head out of the town.

You discover a Goblin. "That's weird it's running straight for m-" you think, unable to finish your train of thought you quickly pull out your stick. Same way you delt with the Slime you swing your stick, but those lazers the receptionist was talking about started appearing. Having to fight a Goblin was bad by itself, but having to dodge lazers at the same time. This caught you off gaurd, but you stayed determined and eventually you got the gobline with a good enough hit and defeated it.

Quickly taking cover you look at your card and realize it's BP went up again.
### Ch.3
What ever was shooting the lazers noticed you and started firing. Surprisingly all the monster didn't take the hint and attack you. You sneakily snuck around the monster taking a few from behind before they spot you.

You see a dungeon enterence in the distance. "That must be where the things that's attack the town must be" you think to yourself. Continuely you try to sneak your way over. Many obsticles stand in the way. There are monsters blocking the enterence.

You eventually make your way up right before the enterence. The lazers where getting blocked by the enterence. You finally run up to the monster and challenge them. It quickly became a 1v3. Two goblins charge from the sides and the one in the front charges in aswell. Doing a crazy spin attack they all back up a little. First you want to deal with the one up front. You quickly charge in getting a few slash attacks in before noticing the goblin starts to fall. You finish the Goblin by spinning to the Goblin to the right of you and dealing the final slash without even looking. Similarly you deal with the other two.
