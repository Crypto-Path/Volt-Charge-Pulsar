## Lore
### Ch.1
You wake up in a new world. You don't remember anything about yourself, well almost... You remember your desire to do everything to the beat of the music.

You see a monster in the distance. It's looks like a green juggly blob, a Slime you realize. You grab a stick from the ground and head in it's direction. Once you arrive at the Slime you hear the battle music start. Time to get serious.

You swing your sword left, down, up, right in any direction that feels right, all to the beat of the music. Beating and battering the slime until it lies exhausted. It burts into orbs that your body absorbs. Experience? No! Beat Power.

In the distance you see a town. You head to the town with nothing better to do. There you find a guild. Your next mission: become an adventurer.
### Ch.2
You walk into the guild and meet the receptionist. She doesn't recognize you and asks "Here to register?". You nod. She has you put your hand on an orb. After a minute or two you she gives you a card with basic information about yourself. On that card you see something, something that will change your life forever: "Beat Power: 1".

Realizing your potential and the limitless possibilities of "Beat Potential". You decide to get a quest to increase your level. You ask the receptionist for a quest, and feeling the confidence in the new power surging inside you. You ask for a difficult one. She obtains a smug look, "Our town has been attack relentlessly by lazers from up north. We don't know what they're coming from, but they're becoming a great danger to our town. If you deal with this problem you'll become the village hero!". Hearing this you accept the quest and head out of the town.

You discover a Goblin. "That's weird it's running straight for m-" you think, unable to finish your train of thought you quickly pull out your stick. Same way you delt with the Slime you swing your stick, but those lazers the receptionist was talking about started appearing. Having to fight a Goblin was bad by itself, but having to dodge lazers at the same time. This caught you off gaurd, but you stayed determined and eventually you got the gobline with a good enough hit and defeated it.

Quickly taking cover you look at your card and realize it's BP went up again.
### Ch.3
What ever was shooting the lazers noticed you and started firing. Surprisingly all the monster didn't take the hint and attack you. You sneakily snuck around the monster taking a few from behind before they spot you.

You see a dungeon enterence in the distance. "That must be where the things that's attack the town must be" you think to yourself. Continuely you try to sneak your way over. Many obsticles stand in the way. There are monsters blocking the enterence.

You eventually make your way up right before the enterence. The lazers where getting blocked by the enterence. You finally run up to the monster and challenge them. It quickly became a 1v3. Two goblins charge from the sides and the one in the front charges in aswell. Doing a crazy spin attack they all back up a little. First you want to deal with the one up front. You quickly charge in getting a few slash attacks in before noticing the goblin starts to fall. You finish the Goblin by spinning to the Goblin to the right of you and dealing the final slash without even looking. Continueing the spin attack you deal with the other two Goblins. Now all the stands in your way is this dungeon.
### Ch.4
Entering the dungeon you notice an army of monsters. Not just Goblins and Slime, but Orcs and Ogres aswell, but you know you can take them all. Without even looking at your BP you know nothing stands a chance again the beat that resides in your soul.

You burst in swords swinging. None of the monster have any time to react, your bpm is just too high. All the excitement. Slashes in every direction. You feellike your getting stronger every slash you make. Luckily no lazers where coming for you, so you where able to release your full power. All of the lazers would have been blocked by the walls of the dungeon. Not to mention whatever was attacking was at the top of the tower.

A strong buff monster made it's way out. Nothing like you've ever seen. It emenated danger, but you knew this was not time to back down. You continued you stream of attacks in it'd direction, but it's speed match your own. It grabbed your blade bare handed and crushed it. Not to woryy you just picked up another blade. You soon realized you cant keep repeating this forever. There was a finite number of swords. You'd have to out manuever it. You grabbed a sword and shot it at the monsters face. It blocked, but by doing so it covered it's own face, using this chance you grabbed another blade and ran around him and stabbed him in the back. The sword made it in, but the goblin survived thrashing at you from behind. You quickly jump back and try repeating the stategy but the beast learnt and swatted the blade out of the air, and even tried repeating your own stategy, which terrified you. You had another plan, you threw another blade, but this time you followed right behind you. The beast wasn't expecting it and you swung with such force the neck felt like butter.

You stood over the body of the beast, It's time to move on to who or whatever is shooting those lazers. You head up the stairs and into the bright light of the tower and in the midst of another larger army of even stronger monster was it.
